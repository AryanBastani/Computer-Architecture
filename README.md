# Computer Architecture

This repository contains a collection of projects and resources related to computer architecture. It includes Verilog code for various hardware components and system designs, focusing on key concepts such as ALUs, register files, memory modules, and pipelined processors.

## Contents

- **Verilog Codes**: Source files implementing hardware components such as arithmetic logic units (ALUs), registers, memory, controllers, and more.
- **Project Descriptions**: Documentation for each project providing detailed explanations of the design and functionality.
- **Diagrams**: Visual representations of datapaths, control units, and other architectural elements.

## Requirements

- A Verilog compiler or simulator (e.g., ModelSim, Icarus Verilog) is needed to compile and simulate the provided Verilog files.
